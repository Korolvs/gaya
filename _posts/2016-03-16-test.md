Ruby on Rails is a great framework for a quick start, but when a project gets much bigger, a lot of files in controllers, models and views folders can converts to a strong headache for a developer (especially if the developer made some bad decisions at the start of the project). Each edit affected to a big amount of files becomes a real problem. The best way to solve this problems is to use a good architecture from very start of developing the project: separate common parts, use modules and classes in right way etc.

The approach described in this article is called hexagonal architecture (I found this term and a lot of other good stuff here while working with modern PHP frameworks). This architecture extends a common MVC approach adding some new primitives to an application.  

So main primitives are:
 - Commands
 - Middleware
 - Controllers
 - Models
 - Views
 
Models and views are the same as in the original RoR architecture, so I am not writing about them in this article. Also I’m using a project without views as an example and views aren’t described below but you can simply use this architecture for this type of projects too.

## Modules

First of all, to avoid mess in the project this is needed to divide all files to modules. Each module has a one declaration file in models folder and two own folders - one in controllers and one in models. Module contains all the files related to it. The best way is to make modules highly separated from each over. The common examples of modules can be users module and files module.

## Command

The basic primitive in this architecture is a command. Command is a separated action, for instance creating an object or deleting it. Each command contains a validation part and main part that makes all needed actions. Execute method contains business logic and can return a hash or nothing if it doesn’t needed.

In the original RoR architecture there is only model validation, so why do we need to use action validation? With this approach you can easily before running the main code of a command check all input parameters and return to a user what is exactly wrong. After this you don’t need to catch any validation errors in the code and it becomes much more clear. Also you can add a model validation too.  

Each command must be inherited from Core::Command class(or its child of course). Lets take a look at the Core::Command class.

It includes ActiveModel::Validations module to do validation. Also there are a token attribute that is very common and needed for authorization and three methods:
 - initialize - fills a command with given attributes and makes it very easy to use commands with different input parameters.
 - execute - dummy method which must be overridden in every child
 - model_to_validate - returns a model needed to some validation like exists validator and unique validator

Here is an example of command:

## Controller

As all logic is in commands, in controllers you need just to initialize command and run it. This is how it looks like:
